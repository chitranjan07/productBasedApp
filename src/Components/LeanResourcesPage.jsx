            <p className="lead">
              At IOTAFLOW, Lean is our way of working and living.
              <br /><br />
              At IOTAFLOW, Lean is more than a process, itâ€™s a journey weâ€™ve lived together since October 2021,<br />
               and a Godsend opportunity to make a real difference in peopleâ€™s lives. We once worked like machines, <br />
               focused only on output, but Lean has transformed us, putting the training, growth, and well-being of<br />
                our people at the heart of everything we do. What began with learning the 8 Wastes, 2 Second Lean, <br />
                Kanban Cards, the Supermarket Concept, and One-Piece Flow soon became a shared belief that Lean is<br />
                 for people, and people only. Itâ€™s about lifting stress from the shop floor, creating smoother <br />
                 flows of work, and finding joy in solving problems side by side. Lean hasnâ€™t just improved quality<br />
                  and on-time delivery, itâ€™s turned our workplace into a community where everyone feels valued,<br /> 
                  challenges are faced together, and every small improvement is a step toward a better day for us 
                  all.
